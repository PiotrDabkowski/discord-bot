# ElevenBot

## Welcome to the beta branch! This branch is for future changes that might make it into the actual bot!

### Future additions:
1. Add audio effect (Reverb, chorus, etc) support.
2. Add low and high pitch addition support.
3. Add the ability to slow down and speed up audio based on tags (i.e "The [slow=0.5] quick brown fox [/slow] jumps over the [fast=1] lazy dog [/fast].).
4. Implement the v2 english and multilingual models.


## If there are any changes in here you would like me to add, DM me with what you want and I'll add it in here.
