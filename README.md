# ElevenBot

### This bot interacts with ElevenLabs API.

To use the code for your own bot, add your bots token in line 4. You also must be on the "Starter" plan or above to use custom voices. You can still use the bot on the "Free" plan, but only the premade voices.

~~Multilingual model support will come in a future update to the bot.~~ **Multilingual models are now supported.**

## This bot will require you to input your API key to login and it will be saved. This will never be used for malicious purpose however. 

I will never use your API key for anything malicious. 

## If you really dont trust this though, if you have previously logged in, you can run '/logout' to remove the key from storage.

#### If any issues happen with the bot, please DM @HawtCawfeeâ˜•#1337.
