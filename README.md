# ElevenBot

## Welcome to the beta branch! This branch is for future changes that might make it into the actual bot!

### Future additions:
1. Add audio effect (Reverb, chorus, etc) support. **(Added successfully.)**
2. Add low and high pitch addition support. **(Working on adding in a few days.)**
3. Add the ability to slow down and speed up audio based on tags (i.e "The [slow=0.5] quick brown fox [/slow] jumps over the [fast=1] lazy dog [/fast].). **(Impossible to add because during testing, output audio would skip occasionally)**
4. Implement the v2 english and multilingual models. **(Will add after number 2 is implemented and fully working)**


## If there are any changes in here you would like me to add, DM me with what you want and I'll add it in here.
